# A Descriptive Schema for Escape Games

This journal article explores the relationships between different forms of 'escape games.'

It is a snapshot of the landscape of escape games as it existed in early 2020. It identifies four types of escape games: the digital point-and-click escape game, the tabletop escape game, the live-action escape room, and the virtual reality escape game. It frames an escape game as a collection of objects that are mediated differently depending upon the type of game.

Future work will build on this snapshot by delving into the past and future of escape games. How did the 2020 landscape come to be? And escape games have continued to develop since 2020. Live-action escape rooms found ways to host their games remotely. Recent video games like Escape Simulator are digital like the point-and-click games, but take more genre conventions from the live-action games.

This formal framework can also be used to analyze other types of games across media, such as board games and their digital adaptations.
