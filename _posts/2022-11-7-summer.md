# Retelling All Summer in a Day

This game is an interactive form of Ray Bradbury's short story, "All Summer in a Day." The player takes on the role of William, a child on Venus. The sun is coming out for the first time in seven years. It was developed using Ink.

This project uses limited choices to explore the concept of character agency. This early draft was developed as an example for my Fall 2022 Foundations of Interactive Design course. The idea to create a retelling of a classic story for this course was originally by prior instructor Kenton Taylor Howard.
